👋 Welcome to My Page!

This space is where I share my current work, research interests, and exploratory projects—especially those focused on measurement techniques and user research.
You'll find content that reflects my evolving curiosity and the lessons learned through trial and error. It's a work-in-progress, just like any research process.

🔍  Right Now...

I'm developing guides and tools for the following topics, and will share more as they evolve:

- Survey Design and Analysis Workflow  
- Automating Survey Analysis and Report Building  
- Survival Analysis  
- Simulation Studies

Thank you for stopping by! Feel free to explore, reach out, and follow along as this space grows.
