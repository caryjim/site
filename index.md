Welcome to my page!

In this space, you can find activities related to my current work, research interests, and exploratory work that focus on measurement techiques and user research.

Currently, I'm interested in the following and will share more as they are being developed!

* Survey Design and Analysis Workflow
* Automate Survey Analysis to Report Building
* Survivial Analysis
* Simulation Study
