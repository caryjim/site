👋 Welcome to my page!

This space is where I share my current work, research interests, and exploratory projects - especially those focused on measurement techiques and user research. 
You will find items that reflects my evolving curiosity and the lesson learned through trial and error. It's a work-in-progress, just like any research process itself. 

🔍Right Now... 
Currently, I'm developing guides for the following topics will share more as they are being developed!

* Survey Design and Analysis Workflow
* Automate Survey Analysis to Report Building
* Survivial Analysis
* Simulation Studies

Thank you for stopping by! Feel free to explore, reach out, and follow along as this space grows.
